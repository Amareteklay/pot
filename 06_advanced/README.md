# Advanced Econometric Topics

The final chapter surveys cutting-edge methods that extend beyond the core econometrics curriculum.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand identification and estimation strategies for instrumental variables and regression discontinuity designs.
- Implement generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators and assess specification tests.
- Explore spatial econometrics and machine learning augmentations in causal inference.
- Integrate advanced techniques into applied research workflows.

## Outline

1. **Instrumental Variables (IV)**: relevance and exogeneity, two-stage least squares, weak instruments.
2. **Regression Discontinuity (RD)**: sharp vs. fuzzy designs, bandwidth selection, graphical analysis.
3. **Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)**: moment conditions, estimators, Hansen/Sargan tests, efficiency considerations.
4. **Spatial Econometrics**: spatial lag/error models, weighting matrices, estimation challenges.
5. **Machine Learning Extensions**: double machine learning, causal forests, targeted regularization.
6. **Frontier Topics**: synthetic controls, Bayesian econometrics, reinforcement learning in policy evaluation.

## Resources

- Case studies using real policy interventions to illustrate IV and RD.
- Templates for GMM estimation in Python and R.
- Reading list covering canonical papers and recent developments.

## Exercises

- Diagnose instrument strength and validity in an empirical example.
- Implement an RD design with varying bandwidths and discuss sensitivity.
- Derive and program a simple GMM estimator, evaluating over-identification tests.
