# Preface

The preface outlines the motivation for the Personal Open Textbook (POT), sets expectations for how to use the material, and documents the workflow powering the project.

## Why POT Exists

- Capture clear explanations that connect statistical intuition with econometric rigor.
- Provide a personal knowledge base that can double as course material or workshop content.
- Encourage reproducible research habits through open data and transparent code.

## How to Navigate

1. Start by reading the learning objectives at the top of each chapter.
2. Skim the conceptual overview before diving into derivations or examples.
3. Run the example notebooks to cement understanding and adapt them to your own questions.
4. Use the embedded links to jump between chapters and related references.

## Study Plans

- **Self-paced learners**: Follow the syllabus order, spending at least one week per chapter and completing the applied exercises.
- **Instructors**: Treat each chapter as a moduleâ€”mix and match sections to build lectures, labs, or assignments.
- **Project-based learners**: Use the data catalog and utils scripts to replicate analyses or build mini research projects.

## Tooling Checklist

- Python (NumPy, pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn) and/or R (tidyverse, broom, fixest).
- Jupyter or Quarto for notebooks and reports.
- Git for version control, with pre-commit hooks recommended.

## Contributing

Guidelines for contributing to POT live in the repository root. Draft pull requests are welcome for typo fixes, new examples, or additional datasets.
